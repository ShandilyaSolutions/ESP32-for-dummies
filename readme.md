# Hello World using ESP32

Just like all traditional programming language you must start your ESP32 journey by performing the Hello World ritual. 

I am assuming that you have already configured Arduino IDE for ESP32. 

## Code

Paste the code from this  file into the new file : [HelloWorld](https://github.com/ShandilyaSolutions/ESP32-for-dummies/blob/main/hello_world.ino)
 Save it!
 
 Compile it!

 And upload it to your ESP32 board. Once the code is uploaded open the Serial Monitor window by pressing *CTRL+Shift+M*. 

You will see the following screen: ![Serial Monitor](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/arduino/assets/images/SerialPrintHelloWorld_SerialMonitor.png)
